# Random LaTeX stuff I use
- `LaTeX-lecture-notes-class` is not mine, but rather downloaded from [vhbelvadi's repo](https://github.com/vhbelvadi/LaTeX-lecture-notes-class). I probably made some changes tho, so I keep my version around.
- `mluexercise` is a homework template from my Uni, which I also probably changed up a bit.
- `mysuff` contains some quick-and-dirty scripts and shortcuts I use.
